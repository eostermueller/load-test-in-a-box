Snail4j provides self-paced Java education, with a focus on troubleshooting performance problems.
It is a load-test-in-a-box -- a library of commonly found performance defects (and their antidotes) that run on your desktop.
Also good for code reviewing the performance of your own code.

# Goals
* Installs/runs in less than 5 minutes.
* Runs on MS-Win, Mac, and Linux
* Pure Java (and I guess browser)
* Uber jar distribution
* Can install from a USB stick, no internet access required.
