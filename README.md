# Motivation
This project challenges end users (java developers) to [solicit predictions](https://blog.upperlinecode.com/stop-teaching-code-a1039983b39) on software performance experiments with main types of software defects:  
 * Persistence
 * Alien systems
 * Threads
 * Heap

(the acronym is P.A.T.H.)

 Helpful predictions to solicit from the end user:

 * Does performance improve with fewer or more invocations to the database?
 * How large must a payload be to degrade transmission time?
 * How much delay is required to slow down code with a sync block?

# Goals
* Quick and easy "[No Friction](https://github.com/eostermueller/snail4j/wiki/No-Friction-Distribution)" distribution.
* Provides self-paced, hands-on experience troubleshooting java performance.
* Great for a performance code review.
* Testing environment for any monitoring solution, to quickly test resource overhead of monitoring, confirm that monitoring can detect perf defects.
