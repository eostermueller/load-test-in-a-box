Snail4j is a load-test-in-a-box that aims to educate all Java developers on software performance.

# Motivation
Snail4j challenges the end user to [solicit predictions](https://blog.upperlinecode.com/stop-teaching-code-a1039983b39) on software performance experiments with main types of software defects:  
 * Persistence
 * Alien systems
 * Threads
 * Heap

(the acronym is PATH)

 Here are some predictions that snail4j solicits from the end user:

 * Does performance improve with more are less invocations to the database?
 * How large must a payload be to degrade transmission time?
 * How much delay is required to really slow down code using Java synchronization?

# Goals
## Easy Install for Quick Meeting/Classroom/Conference Discussion
* <5 minute install
* Runs on MS-Win, Mac, and Linux
* Pure Java (and I guess browser)
* Optionally, just copy uber jar from USB stick, no internet access required.
